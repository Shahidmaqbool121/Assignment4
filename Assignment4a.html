    <p><b>Q1:- list out the features of HTML5</b></p>
    Ans:- 1. Semantic Elements

   <p> When constructing an HTML script, the term “semantic” refers to the meaning of the text. Semantics, to put it simply, is the use of HTML tags that accurately reflect the content they contain. For instance, using the div> tag doesn't suggest the content it will carry, however using the p> tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph information. </p>
   2. Audio and Video Support

<P>One of the many HTML 5 features is the support for audio and video. It has reduced the hassle of relying upon third-party services such as Adobe Flash player. To embed Audio and Video into your HTML document, you may use the following two tags, audio> and video> tags. </p>
<p>
These two tags are launched with the release of HTML 5 and support a numerous range of attributes such as height, width, and more that offers developers to leverage the customization of HTML documents. </p>
3. Canvas Elements
<p>
Canvas Elements is a top-notch feature that has made the tedious task of handling graphics easier for developers. With the help of Canvas elements, you can easily draw graphics using JavaScript. It is optimum for creating simple animations and drawing photo compositions. </p>
<p>
To initialize the Canvas element canvas> tag is used with only two specific attributes, width and height. Once, the element is initialized, it is then taken care of with the help of JavaScript to draw shapes, lines, images, and more.</p>
4. Responsive Images
<p>
Earlier to create responsive images on the web, you have to rely upon several lines of CSS and sometimes JavaScript, however, HTML 5 makes the process handy by including srcset attribute to specify multiple versions of an image at different screen resolutions. </p>
5. Form enhancements

<P>HTML 5 introduces new features for your existing forms on HTML to create a more robust user experience. Some of the key enhancements in the new HTML 5 include new input times such as email, URL, and more, placeholder text, required fields feature, validation, and more. </P>
6. Micro Data 
<p>
Micro Data in simpler words is a further deeper level to provide semantics to your webpage. This feature is used to structure data in HTML documents by embedding your own customized elements. </p>

<p><b>Q2:- What are HTML-5 Entities?list out 5 commonly used HTML-5 entities?</b></p>
Ans:-An HTML entity is used to display invisible characters and reserved characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code. It is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ).
<ol>
    <li>1.less than: To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60; </li>
    <li>2. Greater than: To display a less than sign (>) we must write: &gt; or &#62;</li>
    <li>3. ampersand: To display a ampersand sign (&) we must write: &amp; or &#38;</li>
    <li>4. double quotation mark: To display a double qoutation mark sign (") we must write: &quot; or &#34;</li>
    <li>5.single quotation mark (apostrophe): To display a single quotation mark (apostrophe)sign (') we must write: &apos; or &#39;</li>

</ol>
<p><b>Q3:- Define accessibility in the context of web development. ?`discus why it is essential to create accessible websites and how it benefits different user groups?</b></p>
Ans:-
<p>Accessibility: addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities. Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers.</p>
<ul>
    <li>IT PROMOTES USABILITY:
        <p>Online content that meets accessibility requirements is likely to be more user-friendly for everyone. People without disabilities can benefit from accessible design, particularly when they are in limiting situations such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading captions for a video when in noisy or quiet environments</li>
            <li>Adjusting screen brightness in a dark or bright room</li>
            <li>Reading a transcript of a presentation to reinforce the information learned</li>
            <li>Using the keyboard to navigate a website when the mouse is not working</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO:</li>
    <p>Accessibility allows people with disabilities to actively participate in our society. In addition to being leaders of innovation and progress, institutions of higher education are also regarded as having a certain level of responsibility to society. Accessibility supports this notion as well as UNCG's mission.</p>
    <li>IT'S THE LAW:</li>
    <p>There are many federal and state laws that require higher ed institutions to make their electronic and web content accessible to people with disabilities. Violating these laws can result in a loss of funding (including federal financial aid funds), as some universities have faced legal action for web accessibility non-compliance. The University of Washington has developed thorough summaries of several higher education resolution agreements and lawsuits(opens in new window) involving web accessibility.  More information about these laws can be found on the Laws & Guidelines related to Accessibility page(opens in new window)</p>
    
</ul>
<p><b>Q4:- list any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML?</b></p>
Ans:-
<ol>
    <li> HTML Accessibility:
        <p>Always write HTML code with accessibility in mind! <br>
            Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as possible. <br>Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the (button) element (and not a (div) element).

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Headings Are Important:
        <p>Headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags <br>Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. <br>Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections. <br>Screen readers also use headings as a navigational tool. The different types of heading specify the outline of the page. h1 headings should be used for main headings, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Alternative Text:
        <p>The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). <br>The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:</p>
    </li>
